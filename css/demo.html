  <h2>Movie reviews</h2>
  <blockquote>
    “Lots of heat but not very much light. It came across as a kind of daytime soap opera version showing the personalities of the players 
    rather than dealing with the nuts and bolts of what really happened.”
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    “I am watching this for the third time, trying to understand how this large group of capitalist pigs could royally screw their families, 
    descendants, neighbors, countrymen and the rest of the whole world with absolutely no compassion.”
